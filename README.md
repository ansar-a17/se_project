SE4CSAI Project

- Here we will be uploading our code for the SE4CSAI project.
- We aim to implement software designed to help visually impaired people better navigate their digital environment by narrating their surroundings. We outline the user, functional and non-functional requirements to provide guidelines and goals to different types of stakeholders, ranging from users to managers to developers.
